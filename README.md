## TL;DR

```bash
cookiecutter gh:JensRoland/python-package-template --checkout v1.2.0
```

## Credit, Improvements & TODOs

This cookiecutter is based on the excellent work by Roman Tezikov <https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/> and remains 99% his creation. I have merely added some features and removed others to make it more suitable for my own needs.

Specifically, this repo includes the following changes/improvements:

    [x] Added a 'Proprietary' license option.
    [x] Moved source code into /src/ folder and changed all linters etc. to target that folder only.
    [x] Changed the 'github_name' input to 'github_username' to avoid confusion.
    [x] Added virtualenvs.in-project = true (to store virtualenv in project/.venv/)
    [x] Fixed a minor bug (incorrect directory) in the post-gen instructions.
    [x] Bumped a few package versions.
    [x] Added pylint to linters.
    [x] isort: Added list of files to skip.
    [x] black: Removed color=true setting because it broke black when running in my VS Code using formatOnSave (OS X w. ZSH)
    [x] Expanded on the post-gen instructions to include pyenv versioning and GitHub repo creation.
    [x] Fixed `make install` so the created virtualenv will use the selected python version.
    [x] VS Code settings.json: added python defaultInterpreterPath (to auto-activate virtualenv) and activated the various linters and pytest
    [x] VS Code launch.json: enable features for running and debugging code.
    [x] Cleaned up the .pre-commit-config.yaml file a bit, e.g. removing the python version because it made commits fail if you were running a higher (but compatible) Python version.
    [x] Mypy linting of Python code
    [x] Makefile update-dev-deps: black no longer needs prerelease version

And in the future I will add:

    [ ] Makefile -> [`Invoke`](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) / [`Nox`](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/)?
    [ ] Auto-documentation with [`MkDocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and possibly [Material Design theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) and [`mkdocstrings`](https://github.com/pawamoy/mkdocstrings).
    [ ] Pytest-xdist for parallelized unit test running.
    [ ] CDK constructs ready for deployment to AWS.
    [ ] Code metrics with [`Radon`](https://github.com/rubik/radon).

## üöÄ Features

In this [cookiecutter üç™](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template we combine state-of-the-art libraries and best development practices for Python.

### Development features

- Supports `Python 3.7` and higher.
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependencies manager. See configuration in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/JensRoland/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/pyproject.toml) and [`setup.cfg`](https://github.com/JensRoland/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/setup.cfg).
- Automatic codestyle with [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort), [`pylint`](https://pylint.org/) and [`pyupgrade`](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade).
- Ready-to-use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks with code-formatting.
- Type checks with [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io); docstring checks with [`darglint`](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint); security checks with [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) and [`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
- Testing with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

#### Demo

[![Demo of github.com/JensRoland/python-package-template](https://asciinema.org/a/422052.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/422052)

### More details

Your project will contain `README.md` file with instructions for development, deployment, etc. You can read [the project README.md template](https://github.com/JensRoland/python-package-template/tree/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D) before.

### Initial set up

#### Initialize `poetry`

By running `make install`

After you create a project, it will appear in your directory, and will display [a message about how to initialize the project](https://github.com/JensRoland/python-package-template/tree/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D#very-first-steps).

#### Initialize `pre-commit`

By running `make pre-commit-install`. Make sure to set up git first via `git init`.

### Package example

Want to know more about Poetry? Check [its documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

<details>
<summary>Details about Poetry</summary>
<p>

Poetry's [commands](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#commands) are very intuitive and easy to learn, like:

- `poetry add numpy@latest`
- `poetry run pytest`
- `poetry publish --build`

etc.
</p>
</details>

#### CLI example

If you set `create_example_template` to be `cli` the template comes with a cute little CLI application example. It utilises [`Typer`](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) and [`Rich`](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) for CLI input validation and beautiful formatting in the terminal.

After installation via `make install` (preferred) or `poetry install` you can try to play with the example:

```bash
poetry run <project_name> --help
```

```bash
poetry run <project_name> --name Jens
```

### Building and releasing your package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish üôÇ `poetry publish --build`

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/JensRoland/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks can be installed after `git init` via:

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort`, and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black`, `darglint`, and `pylint`.

Update all dev libraries to the latest version using one comand

```bash
make update-dev-deps
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Making badges</summary>
<p>


```bash
make extrabadges
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/JensRoland/python-package-template/tree/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>10. Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
make dsstore-remove
```

Remove .mypycache

```bash
make mypycache-remove
```

Or to remove all above run:

```bash
